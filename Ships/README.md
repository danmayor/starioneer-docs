# Space Ships
It's a space flight simulator of course there are space ships, and they are a key element of the designs. In Starioneer, our player will spend virtually all of their time in game at the helm of a ship. Piloting and playing missions, or using the computer to issue commands to their fleet captains.

Space ships in Starioneer will be prefab assets that attach our space ship script and configure it's settings. These prefabs then can be created and managed within our game. To help and provide some clarity in this documentation we will refer to the "Prefab" meaning the root game object of our ship assets. We refer to the "Scripts" meaning the code scripts and configuration that define the ship to other game logic.
