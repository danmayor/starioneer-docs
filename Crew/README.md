# Crew
Keeping with our ships and stations idea we recognize crew is necessary. Crew are required to work at stations, manage stations or captain vessels etc. This intersects with the player as well, the player will need to hire crew and captains to pilot ships in the players fleet.

The crew system will be a simple system where by general crew are just numbers that you need, officer crew will have a simple level system that helps to increase their effectiveness.
