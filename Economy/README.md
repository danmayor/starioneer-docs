# Economy
The economy is an important part of Starioneer, it's the players primary means of making the big bucks they need to build their fleet for the end game battle. The economy we are talking about are the resources, commodities, products and goods that are traded and consumed throughout the universe.

__Resources__  
Resources are things like raw minerals & gases. They are normally inputs for low level commodities.

__Commodities__  
Commodities are created from resources at processing stations.

__Products__  
Products are made from commodities and are used to assemble other products or goods.

__Goods__  
Goods are consumable or luxury items. Player doesn't have need for them but they make money because people are greedy and want goods.

The "economy" of the game lies in our systems that can simulate supply and demand, and use that simulation to drive ship & station spawning. The player can leverage this galactic market to buy, manufacture and sell their way to rich people status.

Ideally we will want to let the player build and customize their own space stations to add to this economy and fast track that money making... Scope and pace of development will determine if this player customized stations concept makes the cut or not.
