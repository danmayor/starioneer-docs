# Starioneer
Starioneer is a fantasy near future space flight simulator game with light strategy and role playing elements. In this game we are looking to tell a story of the "Terran" people discovering FTL / hyperspace travel. A coalition of the planets nations, known as the "Terran Starioneer Program" has partnered with various advanced technologies companies / groups and are now recruiting people to join their ranks and help to start populating the stars!

Our player starts off doing some basic flight training and begins working missions for the Terran Starioneer Program (TSP). These missions will further teach the player about the game and help them earn some money as well as their first shuttly, which in turn unlocks new missions from the various factions that have began settling among the stars.
