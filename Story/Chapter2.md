# Chapter 2: Drawing Lines
The player has earned a small scout vessel with a jump drive and navigational coordinates to home sectors for each of our factions. The player is now free to do side missions from TSP Command, and can jump to these new sectors for the factions.

__Side Missions__  
Perhaps we could have some simple random repeating missions to search for items, signals, transport people around etc.

__The Techies__  
Just a working name, but this faction would be focused around technological and scientifical advancement. 
- Find "weird signals"
- Deploy satellite to location

__The Workers__  
Also a working name, this faction are the manufacturers and commercial business types.
- Find rare ore
- Deploy becon satellite to location

__The Warriors__  
You got it, another working name. This faction is militant but in the name of "peace".
- Transport delegate to The Techies
- Transport delegate to The Workers

__Pirates__  
Of course pirates.. The player should have enough money now to purchase some blasters and shields. Which they will need to help each of our factions with their pirate missions!
- Destroy the pirate ship harrassing The Techies
- Destroy the pirate ship harrassing The Workers
- Join pirate patrol with the Warriors
  - Requires Techies and Workers completed first, awards a small fighter
