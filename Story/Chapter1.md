# Chapter 1: Rising to the call
Chapter one is intended to serve as our tutorial chapter. We will introduce some key Terran entities / factions (TBD), teach the player about space flight and doing missions etc.

The player will learn a bit about the Terran Starioneer Program (TSP), it is a multi-national effort, backed by various advanced technology groups that has streamlined the process of training and deploying new space farers.

Our player has just arrived at the TSP Command station. It's a station on the outer edges of the Terra Nova system. It's the launching point where all new Starioneers find their way. Our player enters training and we begin with flight simulator training.
