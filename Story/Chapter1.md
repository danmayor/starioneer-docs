# Chapter 1: Rising to the call
Chapter one is intended to serve as our tutorial chapter. We will introduce some key Terran entities / factions (TBD), teach the player about space flight and doing missions etc.

This chapter starts with our payer in a "flight simulator". This simulator allows the player to pilot a ship and learn the ropes. Simple tutorial phase where we just teach how to control the ship and move on.

Once the player has completed their flight course, they will be taught about missions. The player will be guided through a couple basic mission types. Such as searching for a gas or mineral, destroying a pirate, transporting passengers.

The chapter continues, the player can accept TSP missions using vessels to earn some quick cash and starting our story line. The player will complete a mission for each faction, becoming acquainted with each before earning their own shuttle and being released into the game universe for real!

[Next: Chapter 2](./Chapter2.md)

## TODO
- Define the actual missions
- Introduce the TSP lore better
