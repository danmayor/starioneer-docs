# Chapter 4: Enter the grays
In this chapter, our player ventures even further out into the universe and comes in contact with the first of our alien species, the little gray guys! In our story, the grays will remain quite secretive but will admit that they have been watching and visiting the Terrans for a very long time. More story will unfold through the missions in this chapter, the overall purpose of this chapter being to introduce and start building a tentative alliance with the grays.

__First Contact__  
The first contact mission is initiated by the grays while the player is exploring one of the new sectors. This mission will be pretty straight forward, player will receive a hail and have a short conversation with a Gray alien. The player is given coordinates and asked to bring representatives from each of the factions to meet with the Grays governing councel.

__Collecting Representatives__  
This mission will require that the player contact the HQ stations of each of the factions to learn the whereabouts of each factions representative. The player will need a comfortable transport ship that can seat at least 4 passengers for the representatives to board.

__The Summit__  
For the big day! The player will jump to the Gray sector with all 4 representatives aboard and make contact with the Gray mothership in the area. This will begin the meet n greet, a dialog that sets the stage that the Grays are interested in Terran-kind but are leary of full friendship.

__Getting from there to here__  
After the summit meeting it's time to take the representatives back to their respective HQ's. Dropping them all off unlocks the following missions.

__Techies gonna tech__  
The player is asked to transport some sample technology to and from the Grays, their little way of sharing knowledge and building trust.

__Workers trade craftsmen__  
The player is asked to transport workers to and from the Grays. Cultural exchange at its finest.

__Warriors Posture__  
The warriors aren't as impressed and seek to increase military might throughout the Terran sectors. The player is asked train rookie pilots (player escorts small fighters on patrols).

Completing all of the above missions will progress to chapter 5.
