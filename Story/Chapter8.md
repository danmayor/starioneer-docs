# Chapter 8: Lets get ready to ruuuuuuumble
This is it, the final assault.  The player learns of the path to the next closest spawn hub sector. Surely locking it down as well would push the spawn far enough away to return to peace.

The player will have a new jump coordinate, will jump in to a heaby Spawn sector. Destroy all the ships and stations here the Grays will setup a defense station. Repeat in the next sector.

The players third jump will take them into intergalactic hell. A seemingly neverending swarm. The player must eradicate them all, destroy all the stations and defend while Gray & TSP convoys come in to build defenses.

Player "wins" the game once both convoys have finished building in the hub final hub sector.

We could allow the player to continue with in an open world that takes place at the end of chapter 7 before the chapter 8 fight.

Maybe DLC could introduce new scenarios / missions in this open world mode.
