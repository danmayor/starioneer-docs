# Chapter 3: Getting down to business
In this chapter we guide our player through their options for building a fleet and eventually their own empire within the universe. We are introducing some new sectors and creating supply shortages to train the player in how to trade for big bucks.

__Side Missions__  
Side missions are now available from TSP Command and the faction home sectors.

__TSP Supply Savior__  
To help push the game along at this point, we will broadcast a mission to the player to help move a certain amount of cargo to ease sypply shortages. Rewards will be a lot of money...
- Receive message from TSP
- Purchase discounted small cargo vessel
- Player can turn in after enough resources have been moved (See end of this chapter)

__The Techies__  
Always exploring and learning but they are running out of the advanced electronics they need to push forward.
- Move X amount of electronic components to Techie stations

__The Warriors__  
The warriors need energy cells and ship components.
- Move X amount of energy cells and ship components to warrior stations

__The Workers__  
Workers need bodies to keep up as products start flowing. But it would be inhumane to shuttle them in using a cargo ship. The workers loan you a transport to go pick up crew.
- Collect and transport X crew members to worker stations
  - The workers let you keep the transport

__TSP Supply Savior__  
After completing all faction quests and turning in the TSP Supply Savior, the player is awarded with a TSP business license. Perfect timing now that the player has a transport, and a cargo ship, a scout and a small fighter.
